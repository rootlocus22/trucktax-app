Hi,

I’m reaching out from **QuickTruckTax**. We run a concierge-style service that helps truckers and fleets with Form 2290 and related compliance—done-for-you filing, support, and tools.

We’re interested in exploring a **partnership** with Precise2290. We see potential in:

- **Referral / co-marketing** – directing our users to you for 2290 e-filing where it makes sense, or vice versa.
- **API / integration** – if you offer a partner or API channel, we could integrate so our users get a seamless “we handle it” experience with filing powered by Precise2290.
- **White-label or reseller** – if that’s something you offer, we’d be open to discussing how we could offer your capability under our brand.

We’re focused on growth through SEO and product-led acquisition and would like to align with a strong 2290 provider rather than overlap. A short call would help us see if there’s a fit.

Would you be open to a 15–20 minute call? I’m happy to work around your schedule.

Best regards,

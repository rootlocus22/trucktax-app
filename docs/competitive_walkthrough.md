# Competitive Upgrades Verification

We have implemented a comprehensive strategy to outmaneuver competitors (specifically eForm2290.com) by aggressively targeting their pricing and feature weaknesses.

## 1. Strategy Implemented
*   **Price Disruption**: Positioned our **$34.99** rate against their $59.99 rate.
*   **Feature Parity**: Added **SMS Status Alerts** and **Free VIN Corrections** to match their unique selling points.
*   **Keywords**: Adopted high-intent terms like "VIN Correction", "Schedule 1", and "Suspended Vehicle".
*   **Simplicity**: Renamed "Concierge" to "Smart E-Filing" to emphasize speed over manual phone calls.

## 2. Changes Made

### A. Homepage (`/`)
*   **Hero Section**: Updated headline to "File Form 2290 Online for Just $34.99". Added subtext "Save 40% vs leading competitors".
*   **Trust Card**: Highlighted the $34.99 flat fee vs $60 competitors.
*   **Features Grid**: Added "Instant SMS Alerts" and "Free VIN Corrections".

### B. State Landing Pages (`/insights/state/[state]`)
*   **Enhanced Template**: Updated the dynamic state page template (e.g., [Texas Guide](/insights/state/texas)).
*   **Aggressive Pricing**: Updated Schema Markup and text to reflect the $34.99 price.
*   **Local SEO**: These pages now capture "2290 Filing in [State]" traffic with competitive messaging.

## 3. Verification
*   **Homepage**: Confirmed $34.99 price and "Instant SMS Alerts" feature are visible.
*   **State Page**: Confirmed Texas state page shows correct pricing and features.

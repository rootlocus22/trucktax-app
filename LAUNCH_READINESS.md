# Launch Readiness: Stage → Main & Silent Launch

**Purpose:** Market and legal check before merging stage to main and doing a silent, SEO-first launch as a **non–IRS-authorized concierge service**.

---

## 1. Is it the right time to merge stage → main?

**Recommendation: Yes, after the copy and legal fixes below are applied.**

- Product is positioned as **concierge / done-for-you**, not as “IRS authorized.”
- Terms and Privacy are in good shape with the suggested tweaks.
- Silent launch (no press, SEO-first) is a good way to validate demand and start earning without legal or reputational risk—**as long as you remove all “IRS authorized” claims** and clarify how filing reaches the IRS (see Legal section).

---

## 2. Legal positioning: non–IRS-authorized concierge

### What the market / IRS expects

- **Form 2290 e-file:** The IRS requires e-filing to go through an **IRS-authorized** Modernized e-File (MeF) provider. You cannot e-file 2290 directly on IRS.gov; a listed provider/transmitter is required.
- **Your positioning:** You are a **concierge service** (expert team, done-for-you). You are **not** claiming to be the IRS or a government agency—good.
- **Critical:** You must **not** say you are an “IRS-authorized e-file provider” unless your business (or a clearly disclosed partner) is on the [IRS Form 2290 MeF provider list](https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/tax-year-2025-form-2290-modernized-e-file-mef-providers). That would be a false claim.

### How to stay legal

- **Option A – You use an authorized provider (API/partner):**  
  In that case you are a concierge that *uses* authorized e-file channels. Say that you “facilitate filing through IRS-authorized e-file channels” or “submit through established e-file channels” — **do not** call yourself “an unauthorized e-file provider” in a way that suggests you transmit outside the system.
- **Option B – You are building your own transmitter:**  
  Do not take live 2290 e-filings until you (or a partner) are on the IRS list. Until then, you can offer preparation, guides, and other services only, or clearly state that filing is done via a partner.
- **Terms wording:**  
  Use language that is true to your model, e.g. that you are a **private concierge and technology service** that assists with preparation and submission, and that **transmission to the IRS** is done in accordance with applicable requirements (e.g. through authorized channels or partners). Avoid “we are an unauthorized e-file provider” if you are in fact using an authorized channel.

## 3. Terms of Service – status and tweaks

**Current state:** Good. You already state:

- You are not the IRS, FMCSA, or any government agency.
- Service fees are for software/support; tax liability is the user’s.
- No legal or professional tax advice; user is responsible for accuracy.

**Suggested change:**  
Replace the line that says you are “an **unauthorized** e-file provider that transmits data to the IRS” with something like:

- “We are a private concierge and technology service. We assist you in preparing and submitting your returns; transmission to the IRS and other agencies is carried out in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.”

(Adjust if you use a named authorized partner—e.g. “through our IRS-authorized e-file partner.”)

---

## 4. Privacy Policy – status and tweaks

**Current state:** Solid. You cover collection, use, security, sharing (government, processors, legal), and contact.

**Suggested additions:**

- **Data retention:** State how long you keep data (e.g. “We retain filing and account data for at least 7 years (or as required by tax/regulatory requirements) for audit and support.”).
- **Cookies:** One short sentence if you use cookies (e.g. “We use essential cookies for session and security; we do not sell cookie data.”).
- **Optional (if you have CA users):** One line that you do not sell personal information and that California residents can request access/deletion (CCPA-style). You can add a short “Your rights” subsection later if needed.

**Optional softening:**  
Change “As an e-file provider, we adhere to security and privacy standards mandated by the IRS” to something like “We follow industry-standard and regulatory security and privacy practices for handling tax and personal data.” That keeps you accurate whether or not you are an “e-file provider” in the IRS sense.

## 5. Silent launch strategy (SEO-first, earn without legal issues)

### What “silent launch” means here

- **No** big press or “we’re live” announcements.
- **Yes** to: SEO, content, and organic traffic so you can rank and convert without drawing regulatory or competitor attention early.

### Tactics that fit your situation

| Tactic | Why it fits |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pillar content + long-tail keywords** | You already have guides and service pages. Target “form 2290 concierge,” “file 2290 done for you,” “2290 filing help,” state-specific and weight-specific queries. |
| **Programmatic / tools** | HVUT calculator, due-date tools, “do I need to file 2290” — drive backlinks and relevance. |
| **No “IRS authorized” in copy** | Keeps you safe and aligns with concierge positioning. |
| **Clear value prop** | “Expert team does it for you,” “Schedule 1 fast,” “no paperwork” — focus on convenience and outcomes. |
| **Later: Product Hunt / directories** | After you have some traction and reviews, a soft launch there can help without overclaiming. |

### Realistic timeline

- SEO often needs **3–6 months** to show meaningful traffic in competitive niches; some see movement in **under 4–8 weeks** with strong intent keywords.
- Silent launch is about **staying legal**, **learning from early users**, and **building revenue gradually** while you refine messaging and conversion.

## 6. Pre-merge checklist (copy & legal)

Before merging **stage → main** (all below have been applied in this branch):

- [x] Remove or replace every “IRS authorized” / “IRS-authorized e-file provider” claim sitewide (FAQ, form-2290 service page, form-8849 page, services hub, schema, meta descriptions, LandingPage FAQ).
- [x] Replace with concierge language: “Expert concierge service,” “We file on your behalf,” “Done for you,” etc.
- [x] Align FAQ pricing with your real offer ($34.99 flat).
- [x] Update Terms with the suggested “concierge + transmission” wording.
- [x] Add to Privacy: data retention, cookies, CCPA-style line; soften the “IRS standards” sentence to “industry-standard.”

After these are done, merging **stage → main** and starting a **silent, SEO-led launch** is reasonable from a legal and positioning standpoint.

## 7. Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Merge stage → main now? | **Yes, after** the copy and legal fixes above. |
| Concierge positioning OK? | **Yes.** You’re not the IRS; you’re a private service. Just don’t claim “IRS authorized” unless true. |
| Terms & Privacy up to mark? | **Mostly.** Small clarifications (Terms) and additions (Privacy) recommended. |
| Silent launch + SEO to earn? | **Yes.** Focus on SEO, content, and tools; avoid false claims; 3–6 months for meaningful SEO is normal. |
| Legal risk if we fix copy? | **Low** for a concierge that either uses authorized e-file channels or clearly states how filing is done and doesn’t overclaim. |
